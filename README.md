 3 Features

1. Donation Progress Tracking:

To implement the Donation Progress Tracking feature, follow these steps:

Database Setup: Ensure you have a database that can store donation records. Each donation should have fields such as donor information, donation amount, donation goal, and status (e.g., "Incomplete," "In Progress," "Completed").

Frontend Display: When users make a donation, update the frontend to display a progress bar or indicator for that specific donation item. Calculate the percentage of the goal that has been reached based on the current donations.

Status Updates: Update the donation status as "Incomplete" when a donation is initiated, change it to "In Progress" as donations accumulate, and finally, mark it as "Completed" when the goal is met.

Clear Visual Feedback: Use different colors or visual cues to represent each status. For example, you can use red for "Incomplete," yellow for "In Progress," and green for "Completed." This provides clear feedback to users about the status of their donations.

2. Interactive Data Visualization:

To enhance the statistics page with interactive data visualization:

Charting Libraries: Choose a charting library like Chart.js or D3.js to create interactive charts.

Data Collection: Collect relevant donation data from your database, such as donation amounts and categories.

Create Charts: Use the charting library to create visually appealing charts. For example, you can create a bar chart to show donation amounts per category.

Interactivity: Make the charts interactive. Allow users to hover over data points for more information, and implement features like zooming and panning for large datasets.

3. Real-Time Notifications:

To implement real-time notifications:

Backend Setup: Set up a backend system that can send notifications to clients in real-time. This can be done using technologies like WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE).

Notification Types: Define different types of notifications, such as "Donation Success" or "Donation Update."

Client-Side Integration: On the client-side, establish a connection to the server using WebSockets or SSE.

Sending Notifications: When a donation is successfully made or when there are updates to a user's donations, send the corresponding notification to the client.

Display Notifications: Display these notifications to the user in a non-intrusive way, such as a small notification banner or a pop-up. Allow users to dismiss notifications if they wish.

By following these steps, you can successfully implement the Donation Progress Tracking, Interactive Data Visualization, and Real-Time Notifications features to improve the user experience on your donation platform.
